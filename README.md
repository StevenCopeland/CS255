Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? The DriverPass project concerned a client (DriverPass) who wanted a system for allowing customers to take driving lessons and study for driving exams. They wanted customers to be able to access this information online and schedule appointments online.

What did you do particularly well? I think I did pretty well with the various diagrams and charts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I think I could've gone into more depth with my assumptions and limitations on the Business Requirements Document from project 1. I would include a few more limitations and assumptions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I tried to consider the user's needs mainly by considering what they said in the interview and reading it in the context of modern web applications and what customers expect from them. This is important because users often don't have the technical knowledge to articulate exactly what the design should look like, so some interpretation is usually required.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? My approach to designing software is to get working prototypes done quickly and solicit feedback from users before polishing and adding features. I think this can help clarify the initial plan and business requirements and prevent a lot of wasted development time working on features that don't fulfill user requirements.
